# Cpu-Protector
Simple bash script that protects your cpu while mining 

This script stops the mining process when the temp of the cpu reaches over 80 celcius or anything you want, and continues the mining process when the cpu has cooled down to 70 celcius or whatever you set in the script.

You can also get notifications to discord through webhooks if you assign one in the script, it will send a temp update every 10 minutes and will send if the cpu reaches over 80 celcius thus ending the mining, when it cools down to under your set limit it will start again, just remember to configure the script so it executes the right commands.
